      <h1>Meet The Developer</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there, my name is Isaiah. I'm a full-stack developer currently attending
        community college with plans on obtaining my B.A in computer science as well as cyber security training.
        I am predominantly self-taught, I started programming when I was around fourteen and later on as my interests
        grew I began jumping around between game development, to mobile applications, to desktop software, and finally web development.
        Programming is more than just a hobby for me, it's my passion. I love to create and I look forward to the day where my work,
        my creations help make a difference in the world.
